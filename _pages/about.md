I am currently a second year master's student in [CSE, SJTU](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am leading the MemArts (Memory Architecture and System) team to build a disaggregated memory and cache layer in the Huawei cloud. I received my Ph.D. degree (advised by Prof. Yu Hua) in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019 and was a visiting Ph.D. student (advised by Prof. Yuan Xie) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) during 2018-2019. I received a B.E. degree in Computer Science from HUST in 2014.

My research interests span memory and storage systems, distributed systems, and machine learning systems. I have published 30+ refereed papers in major conferences and journals in the areas of computer systems and architectures, including SOSP, OSDI, MICRO, ASPLOS, FAST, USENIX ATC, VLDB, DAC, etc. I obtained the 2020 ACM China Doctoral Dissertation Award (only two awardees among all computer disciplines across China every year) and the Best Paper Award in FAST 2023.

I am a second year master's student in [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Zhenzhe Zheng](https://zhengzhenzhe220.github.io/) for some work related to computer vision and federated learning. Now, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Pengfei Zuo](https://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/) at Huawei. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests lie in algorithmic studies of large language models and related system-level optimisation.
