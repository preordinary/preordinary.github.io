## Bio

I am currently a second year master's student in [CSE, SJTU](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am supervised by [Prof. Zhenzhe Zheng](https://zhengzhenzhe220.github.io/) and [Researcher Pengfei Zuo](https://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am very grateful to my two supervisors. They taught me how to do scientific research and how to cultivate my own scientific research taste.
