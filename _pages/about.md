I am a second year master's student in [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests lie in algorithmic studies of large language models and related system-level optimisation.

Currently, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Zhenzhe Zheng](https://zhengzhenzhe220.github.io/) for some work related to computer vision and federated learning. Now, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Pengfei Zuo](https://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/) at Huawei.inc, where I have explored the optimisation of large model inference and training at the system level.
