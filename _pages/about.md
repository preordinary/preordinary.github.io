I am currently a second year master's student in [CSE, SJTU](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am supervised by [Prof. Zhenzhe Zheng](https://zhengzhenzhe220.github.io/) and [Researcher Pengfei Zuo](https://pfzuo.github.io/homepage/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I have much experience with LLM algorithm and system, federated learning and computer vision. I have conducted some research in LLM training checkpoint system, which focuses on using multi-level cache for checkpointing and overlapping checkpointing with training process. With this research, one can training LLM model with least checkpoint overhead and gain maximum probability for fault recovery. Moreover, I have conducted research in LLM inference acceleration algorithm, in which we observed some insights when different LLM processing, and proposed a novel skipping-layer algorithm which can skip some unimportant layers when inferring. With this research, one can achieve a significant degree of acceleration during LLM inference with minimal accuracy loss. 

As an acknowledgment of my contributions, I've had the privilege to finish 3 papers (3 as first/co-first author), file 2 patents (2 as first student author after my supervisor), and currently have 3 first/co-first author papers under review. 

My research interests lie in algorithmic studies of large language models and related system-level optimisation.
