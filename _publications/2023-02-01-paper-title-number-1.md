* Developed a novel pluggable and lightweight module for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), which evaluates the quality of an image against human evaluation criteria without a reference image. 
* The proposed module (PLS) compliments existing backbone neural network model solutions by simultaneously extract local and global information and amplifying critical details to improve assessment accuracy. 
* Conducted tests and evaluations on six NR-IQA benchmark datasets and tested PLS with different backbone models, allows flexible generalization of existing backbone models without significant retraining while achieving competitive results.
