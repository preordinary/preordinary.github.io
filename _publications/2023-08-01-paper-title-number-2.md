- Introduced a disentanglement approach to Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG), where the main objective is to generalize into unseen domains under the context of Federated Learning. 
- Used a global model to extract domain-invariant features and a local model to extract domain-specific style features. 
- Utilized contrastive learning for separate learning of domain-invariant and domain-specific features, designed one reconstruction loss functions for preserving information among features. 
- Conducted tests and experiments on various benchmarks, demonstrating outstanding performance and even surpass most centralized DG methods.
